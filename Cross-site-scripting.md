# What's XSS

<p> XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page viewed by other users. This can be done by exploiting a vulnerability in a web application that does not properly validate user input, such as a search field or comment section. 

When a user visits the affected web page, the malicious code can execute on their browser and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or session tokens. The attacker can also use this vulnerability to modify the content of the web page and trick users into performing unintended actions.

XSS attacks can be prevented by properly validating and sanitizing user input, encoding output data, and implementing security measures like Content Security Policy (CSP). Web developers should also stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices and vulnerabilities to protect their applications from attacks. </p>
